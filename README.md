# Noughts-and-Crosses
Mr Thompsons Noughts and Crosses Game
This is a "learning" noughts and crosses game.
It is completely "dumb" when you first run it, but watches every move and builds up an "Experience" base, learning which moves are successful (result in a win) and which moves are unsuccessful (result in a loss)
Eventually (after a dozen games or so) it starts to become quite a reasonable player.

The user interface is pretty clunky, because ultimately I want this to be played by a uArm Swift robot arm, using a pixy camera to "see" user moves (using blue discs for X and red discs for O so the pixy can easily identify moves).

I'm a beginner python programmer, hacking my way through this as best I can! If you have any suggestions on how to improve this program, please feel free to make suggestions / improvements.
